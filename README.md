## üìù Overview

This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset without relying on GPU. It is tailored for scenarios where GPU resources are unavailable.  
Key parts:

- Data normalization and visualization  
- Model architecture design  
- Training and validation process  
- Model evaluation with visual outputs  
- Sample predictions on test images

## üõ† Tools & Libraries

| Purpose | Library / Framework |
|---|---|
| Neural networks / model building | TensorFlow / Keras |
| Numeric operations / array handling | NumPy |
| Plotting / Visualizations | Matplotlib |
| Confusion Matrix & Metrics | scikit-learn |

## üìä Dataset & Preprocessing

- Dataset: CIFAR-10 (60,000 32√ó32 color images in 10 classes)  
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Normalize pixel values to [0, 1] range  
  - One-hot or sparse labels depending on setup  
  - Train / validation split supplied by the dataset

---

## üß† Model Architecture

- Three convolutional layers + MaxPooling layers  
- Flatten + Dense hidden layer  
- Final Dense layer with softmax activation for classification into 10 classes

---

## ‚öô Training Details

- Training on CPU  
- Number of epochs: **5** (you may increase later if time allows)  
- Batch size: 64  
- Loss function: sparse categorical crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam
